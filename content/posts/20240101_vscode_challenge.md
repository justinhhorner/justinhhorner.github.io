It's a new year, so naturally I'm kicking it off with a challenge. <!--more--> The challenge is to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) exclusively for the month of January and by the end of February, have a list of every customization and extension I used to make VS Code as close as possible to my Neovim experience.

Before going any further, I should note that I have used VS Code before. I replaced Sublime Text with VS Code to make quick edits to JSON/XML files and some occasional JavaScript projects (I also contributed to it in 2017), but it's never been my primary editor.

Throughout the month, I'll be using C and C++ primarily and occasionally writing Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and blog posts in Markdown. Additionally, I have a custom environment setup written in PowerShell that I'll need to update for this challenge.

I've already started using VS Code to create this blog and build a custom version of the awesome risotto theme. My first impression of VS Code since the last time I used it is that the defaults could be much better and the UI is a disaster.Â 

Frankly, I'm already dreading making this into something I would consider usable. I think I know the first question you have.

## Why? 
I'm sure by now you're asking, why would any self-respecting Neovim user bother with VS Code? Unfortunately, this is out of my control. I'll soon have to use VS Code at work.  The best I can do is try to make it better.

Meta uses VS Code as the [default platform for development](https://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-microsofts-visual-studio-code-is-now-our-default-development-platform/), and although other editors can be used in some cases (Unity and Python for example), obviously investment in tooling will continue to be done via our custom build of VS Code. This challenge is a means to customize it and then build proficiency to be as productive as possible from the start.

Although I will be using VS Code during the challenge for personal Unity and Python projects, at work I will continue to use JetBrains Rider and PyCharm due to the current project setup that's already in place.

## Outcome
In late February or early March, I plan to take everything I've learned and build it into something I can share. Hopefully, this means for the few of you Vim/Neovim users who need to use VS Code, you can simply benefit from the customizations I've made and continue to extend it with your own preferences.

If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, stay tuned and follow along here and on [X / Twitter](https://twitter.com/justinhhorner) to know when it will be available.

Take care.  
Stay awesome.

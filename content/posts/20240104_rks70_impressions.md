I have a problem. Well, not a series one, but a problem nonetheless. I've unintentionally turned into a keyboard collector. <!--more--> I don't more keyboards, yet here we are January of 2024 and I already have a new one.

Maybe I should make a YouTube channel to discuss/review keyboards so I can at least justify buying them. I digress.

## The Look
I wanted a wireless (Bluetooth + 2.4Ghz) split keyboard with RGB, and the [Royal Kludge RK-S70](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C88V7LQK) delivers all that with the added benefit of being able to connect the sides for traditional non-split use. The latter seems like a neat feature, but after using a split keyboard I never want to go back to a traditional layout. I could see this being useful at the office when pair programming with someone who doesn't use a split keyboard (I haven't worked in an office since 2016 though).

I really like the color theme as it matches my terminal and code editor theme. There's also a [white version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C88WHV2W?th=1) with a green mint theme.

## The Specs (I care about)
 I'm not going to list every spec about the keyboard here, but you can look at them with the link above. Here are the features I care about:
 * Tactile brown switches (linear silver switches also available)
 * Supports wired, Bluetooth, and 2.4Ghz connectivity
 * Integrated wrist rest
 * RGB 

## Summary
I'm really enjoying this keyboard so far. I'm still getting used to the 75% layout which causes me to use the Fn key more often than I'd like, but I believe with some remapping or use of the macro keys I can make that switch faster. I should mention I was able to get $30 off the keyboard via an Amazon coupon which brought the total down from the original $119.99 price.

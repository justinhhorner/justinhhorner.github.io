# About me
Hello, my name is Justin. I'm a game programmer and software engineer with nearly 20 years of experience building games, tools, apps, and services.

This is where I plan to post articles about what I'm working on and technologies I find interesting, mostly related to math, game engine technology, and game development in general.

I currently work on [Supernatural](https://getsupernatural.com) at [Meta](https://meta.com), a virtual reality experience that provides flow and boxing workouts as well as meditation.
